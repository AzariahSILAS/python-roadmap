In Python, operators are special symbols (or keywords) that perform operations on values or variables. They’re grouped into categories:

1. Arithmetic Operators

Used for basic math:

+ → Addition

- → Subtraction

* → Multiplication

/ → Division (always returns float)

// → Floor division (truncates to integer)

% → Modulus (remainder)

** → Exponentiation (power)

2. Comparison (Relational) Operators

Used to compare values (returns True or False):

== → Equal to

!= → Not equal

> → Greater than

< → Less than

>= → Greater than or equal to

<= → Less than or equal to

3. Logical Operators

Used to combine conditions:

and → True if both are true

or → True if at least one is true

not → Negates (True → False, False → True)

4. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables (with optional operations):

= → Simple assignment

+= → Add and assign

-= → Subtract and assign

*= → Multiply and assign

/= → Divide and assign

//= → Floor divide and assign

%= → Modulus and assign

**= → Exponent and assign

5. Bitwise Operators

Operate on bits (binary level):

& → AND

| → OR

^ → XOR (exclusive OR)

~ → NOT (inverts bits)

<< → Left shift

>> → Right shift

6. Identity Operators

Check if two objects are the same object in memory:

is → True if both variables point to the same object

is not → True if they point to different objects

7. Membership Operators

Check if a value is in a sequence (list, string, tuple, etc.):

in → True if value exists in sequence

not in → True if value does not exist in sequence
