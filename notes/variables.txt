1. What is a Variable?

A variable is a named reference to a value stored in memory.

Example:

x = 10
name = "Azariah"


Here, x refers to the integer 10, and name refers to the string "Azariah".

🔹 2. Rules for Naming Variables

When creating variable names, Python follows these rules:

Must start with a letter (A–Z, a–z) or underscore (_).

✅ name, _age, value1

❌ 1value, -num

Can contain letters, digits, and underscores.

✅ user_123

Case-sensitive: Name and name are different.

Should not use spaces. Use _ instead.

✅ total_amount

❌ total amount

🔹 3. Reserved Keywords (can’t be used as variable names)

Python has keywords that are reserved for syntax, so you cannot use them as variable names.
Examples include:

and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del,
elif, else, except, False, finally, for, from, global,
if, import, in, is, lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or,
pass, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield


👉 Full list can be found by running:

import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

🔹 4. Best Practices (Conventions)

Not strict rules, but widely followed:

Use snake_case for variable names: user_age, total_sum

Use descriptive names: distance_km instead of just d

Constants are written in UPPERCASE: PI = 3.14159

Avoid single-character names except in short loops (i, j, k).

🔹 5. Examples
# Valid variables
age = 25
user_name = "Azariah"
pi_value = 3.14
_is_admin = True

# Invalid variables
# 1age = 25   ❌ starts with number
# class = "test" ❌ 'class' is a keyword
